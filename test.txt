Article is as follows:
Status Epilepticus (SE) stands as a prominent neurological emergency, showing a mortality rate of approximately 20%. Since February 2021, a worldwide vaccination campaign has been launched against the Coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Several possible vaccine-related adverse events have been identified, including neurological manifestations. SE is beginning to surface in literature as an emergent condition in COVID-19-vaccinated individuals, though defined reasons accounting for this correlation are still missing.,We report two cases of SE related to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In addition, we performed a systematic search of the literature to identify the consistency of the association between the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and the SE onset. The following databases were consulted: PubMed and Google Scholar.,Two novel super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) cases associated with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were identified. Both patients received the second dose of the vaccine about 14 days prior to SE onset. Patients showed a non-convulsive semiology and were treated with a combined anesthetic and immunomodulant therapy, leading to SE resolution in both cases. The literature review identified seven additional cases, primarily non-convulsive SE. Four patients received the Spikevax (ex-COVID-19 Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine), 2 patients the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/Biotech), and 1 patient the ChAdOx1-s (AstraZeneca) vaccine. The first vaccine dose (5/7, 71.4%) emerged as the most frequently associated with SE onset, which manifested at an average of 4.5 days (Â± 3.4) following vaccination. Five patients presented RSE and required continuous intravenous anesthetic drug administration. Resolution of SE was achieved in all cases.,Status Epilepticus is a rare complication associated with Sars-CoV-2 vaccines. Additional studies are needed to ascertain the potential association between Sars-CoV-2 vaccines and status epilepticus.,Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) agents are a critical component of balanced anesthesia. NMB reversal methods can include spontaneous reversal, sugammadex, or neostigmine and the choice of reversal strategy can depend on various factors. Unanticipated changes to clinical practice emerged due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a better understanding of how NMB reversal trends were affected by the pandemic may help provide insight into how providers view the tradeoffs in the choice of NMB reversal agents.,
